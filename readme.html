This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:
 
Orio P., Parra A., Madrid R., Belmonte C. and Viana F. (2011)
Role of the Hyperpolarization Activated Current (Ih) in the Firing
Pattern of Mammalian Cold Thermoreceptor Endings.
J Neurophysiol 108:3009-3023 (2012)
published ahead of print September 5, 2012, doi:10.1152/jn.01033.2011

This is a model for temperature-dependent bursting firing patterns,
inspired by Braun et al. (Int J Bif Chaos 8:881-889 (1998)), with
added hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) and a TREK1-like
potassium current. Also, there is a minor modification in the slow
repolarizing current.

This simulation code requires NEURON freely available from
http://www.neuron.yale.edu

How to run the model:  Auto-launch from ModelDB or
1) compile the supplied mod files
2) run or double-clic mosinit.hoc

You will be prompted to choose type of simulation and type of Ih:
1) The type of simulation
- V traces @34, 30 and 25ºC: This is to produce voltage traces similar
to Figures 7A and 8A.
- 6 temperature steps (ISI plot): This will run a longer simulation
(300s) with temperature steps at 34, 32, 30, 28, 26 and 24ºC. No
voltage trace will be plotted but instead a firing rate plot, an ISI
plot and a temperature trace.  Also a 'Save' button will be provided
that will generate a file called "APdata.txt". This text file will
contain three columns: Time of spike, ISI and temperature. With this
data the Figures 7B, 8B and 10A can be generated.
- Effect of ZD (ISI plot): This will also run a 300s simulation with a
firing rate and ISI plots, similar to Figures 7C, 8C and 10B. Spike
time data can also be saved.

- Effect of ZD with v-trace: A shorter simulation with the voltage
trace while the Ih conductance is being reduced.

2) The type of Ih:
- wild type (HCN1): tau=125 ms (@25ºC) and V0=-85 mV. (Figure 7) For
example, after selected from the initial dialog box and "Run" is
pressed you should see an image similar to:
<img src="fig7.png" alt="fig 7">

- slow Ih (HCN2): tau=900 ms (@25ºC) and V0=-95mV, (Figure 8)
- slow Ih gh=0.2: tau=900 ms (@25ºC), V0=-95mV and gbar_ih=0.2 mS/cm2
(Figure 10)
